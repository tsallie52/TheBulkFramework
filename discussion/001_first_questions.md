# Discussion Thread 001: First Questions for the Bulk Framework  

Welcome, and thank you for taking the time to explore this project.  
Below are the *core questions* we’re hoping to investigate together.  
Please respond with reasoning, references, equations, or counterarguments.

## 🌌 Conceptual Questions

1. **Conservation and Covariance**  
   - Within General Relativity, local energy–momentum conservation is expressed through ∇·T = 0.  
     Could a large-scale energy exchange between black-hole horizons and cosmic acceleration coexist with this principle?  
     What form might that exchange take without violating covariance?

2. **Thermodynamic Parallels**  
   - Black holes have entropy and temperature.  
     Could dark energy represent the diffuse thermodynamic complement to this localized entropy—essentially the “heat” radiated into spacetime itself?

3. **Emergent or Effective Field?**  
   - If the Bulk acts as an intermediary field, could it be modeled as an effective scalar or tensor field coupled to curvature?  
     Would that yield any term similar to the cosmological constant?

4. **Observable Tests**  
   - What data sets could even begin to falsify this connection?  
     (LIGO ringdown residuals, black-hole mass-density vs. Hubble acceleration correlations, etc.)  

5. **Null Hypothesis**  
   - If the idea is fundamentally inconsistent with GR, where exactly does the contradiction arise?  
     (E.g., does it break locality, violate Bianchi identities, or duplicate vacuum energy?)

## 🧩 Collaboration Notes

- Feel free to open subthreads for each question.  
- Cite relevant work (arXiv links or papers).  
- Stay constructive — disagreement sharpens the model.  
- If you create figures, derivations, or simulations, reference them here.
